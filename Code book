#Project Description  
This project means to collect and clean the sumsung smartphone sensor data.  

#Study design and data processing  
The raw data was collected from:  
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip   
file was downloaded through with command  
download.file(url= "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip",destfile = "datafile.zip")  

downloaded data came in with zip format, and it contains a set of test data and a set of train data  
data files used in the project include:  
- 'features.txt': List of all features.  
- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.  
- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.  
- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.  
- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.  
- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.  
- 'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30.   

##Creating the tidy datafile  
#Guide to create the tidy data file  
1. The feature names are assigned to the dataset as column names  
    candidate (subject_test) and activity (labels) are created as new columns  
   Then, test and train sets were merged  
2. Variable names containing "mean","std" are extracted, new dataset is created accordingly   
  activity values from 1-6 were replaced with actual description in activity_labels.txt  
#Cleaning of the data  
  variables candidate and activity are set as id with rest columns as measures  
  records for each activity for each candidate are listed as an unit   
  
##Description of variables  
str(tidydata)  
data.frame:	180 obs. of  81 variables
